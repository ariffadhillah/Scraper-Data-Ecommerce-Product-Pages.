37,Kaiyo Mizunara Oak Cask Strength,5,(3 Reviews),£110,"This is cask-strength edition of Kaiyo's Mizunara matured whisky. It's a rare beast, as there's not much Mizunara – Japanese oak – and only a tiny amount gets turned into whisky casks. It's worth the effort, as it adds a distinctly Japanese edge to the whisky, layering on incense-laden spiciness.

41,The Nikka 12 Year Old,5,(16 Reviews),£125,"A blend including whisky from Nikka's two distilleries, Yoichi and Miyagikyo, The Nikka 12 is a well-balanced blend. There's green-apple freshness, rich fruitcake spiciness, butterscotch and some green-peppercorn punch. Another winner from Nikka.
